Explain the meaning of ADA dental code 39: CT of facial bone. ADA dental code 39: CT of facial bone is a diagnostic procedure that involves the use of computed tomography (CT) to obtain detailed images of the facial bones. This procedure is used to diagnose and evaluate various conditions affecting the facial bones, such as fractures, tumors, infections, and other abnormalities. The CT scan provides a three-dimensional view of the facial bones, which can help doctors identify the location, size, and shape of the bone abnormalities. The procedure is typically performed by a radiologist or a dentist who specializes in oral and maxillofacial radiology. The patient is usually asked to lie still on a table while the CT scanner rotates around the head and takes multiple images. The images are then analyzed by a radiologist to\n",
