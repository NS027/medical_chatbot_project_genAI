## THE STRAUMANN R 1. DENTAL IMPLANT SYSTEM  

### 1.1 OVERVIEW  

The Straumann® Dental Implant System offers a wide range of implant lines with diverse body and neck designs and different materials. This Basic Information focuses on the Titanium and Roxolid® Tissue Level and Bone Level implants with a parallel-walled endosteal design. These implants can be placed with the instruments from the Straumann® Surgical Cassette while using very similar surgical procedures.

### 1.2 IMPLANT LINES  

#### 1.2.1	 Straumann® Standard Implant – The classic Tissue Level Implant  

Straumann® Standard Implants have a smooth neck section of $2.8\mathsf{m m}$ and are especially suitable for classic single-stage procedures, where the implant is placed at soft tissue level and not covered with soft tissue during the healing phase. The Standard Implant uses the Straumann® synOcta® connection together with its corresponding prosthetic components, the Straumann® ­synOcta® portfolio and the Straumann® Solid Abutment. The thread pitch on the Standard Implants measures 1 mm for the $\mathcal{O}3.3\mathsf{m m}$ ­implants, and $1.25\mathsf{m m}$ for all other diameters.  

1.2.2	 Straumann® Standard Plus Implant – The implant for flexible placement Straumann® Standard Plus Implants have a shorter smooth neck section of $\mathsf{1.8m m}$ that allows flexible coronoapical implant placement in combination with transor subgingival healing. This offers the dental surgeon additional options that are particularly useful in the anterior tooth region of the maxilla, where esthetic demands are high. Similar to Straumann® Standard Implants, this implant type uses the Straumann® synOcta® connection together with its corresponding prosthetic components, the Straumann® synOcta® portfolio and the Straumann® Solid Abutment. The thread pitch on the Standard Plus Implants measures 1 mm for the $\varnothing3.3\mathsf{m m}$ implants, and $1.25\mathsf{m m}$ for all other diameters.  

#### 1.2.2.1	 Straumann® Standard Plus Narrow Neck CrossFit® Implant  

The Narrow Neck CrossFit $\mathcal{\textcircled{8}}$ (NNC) Implant is $\mathsf{a}\ 3.3\mathsf{m m}$ diameter implant with a narrow prosthetic platform. Its internal connection provides expanded prosthetic options and solutions for treatment in the upper and lower jaw, wherever space is limited. The NNC Implant is a Standard Plus (SP) Tissue Level Implant with a machined neck of $1.8\mathsf{m m}$ in height. With the introduction of Roxolid® material, it was possible to incorporate an internal CrossFit® connection and, at the same time, offer a strong small-diameter implant – resulting in added confidence for the operator. The implant body and thread design is the same as the Straumann® $3.3{\mathsf{m m}}$ Bone Level NC Implant. Narrow Neck CrossFit® Implants use the Narrow Neck CrossFit® (NNC) prosthetic components.  

#### 1.2.2.2	 Straumann® Standard Plus $4\mathsf{m m}$ Implant  

The Straumann® Standard Plus $4\mathsf{m m}$ Implant is Straumann’s shortest implant. The implant features a Standard Plus design for easy oral hygiene in the posterior regions, synOcta® internal connection compatibility with the existing Tissue Level prosthetic portfolio, and a Bone Level thread to increase the implant-tobone contact. The most advanced Straumann technology combined within a very short implant.

#### 1.2.3	 Straumann® Bone Level Implant – Straumann expertise applied at bone level  

Straumann® Bone Level Implants are suitable for bone level treatments in combination with trans- or subgingival healing. The implant’s rough surface extends to the top of the implant and the connection is shifted inwards. The Bone Level Implant uses a conical-cylindrical connection, the CrossFit® connection, together with its corresponding prosthetic CrossFit® components from the Bone Level product portfolio. A cylindrical outer contour and a thread pitch of $0.8\mathsf{m m}$ that tapers off in the coronal part of the implant provide excellent primary stability.

### 1.3 IMPLANT-ABUTMENT CONNECTIONS  

#### 1.3.1	 Straumann® synOcta® Morse taper connection  

The Straumann® synOcta® concept was introduced worldwide in 1999, using the well-known Morse taper design principle developed in 1986. The mechanically locking friction fit of the Straumann® synOcta® internal connection, with an $8^{\circ}$ cone and an octagon for the repositioning of prosthetic parts, shows improved performance over traditional external connections. Abutment loosening, even in screw-retained situations, has virtually been eliminated.  

The Straumann® synOcta® connection is available for all Straumann® Standard and Standard Plus, Implants with the Regular Neck (RN) and Wide Neck (WN) platform.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/9537a55e1546d1f0deae2c967da11db4da79091534f1bc750ddbf10123c3e37a.jpg)  

#### 1.3.2	 Straumann® Narrow Neck CrossFit® connection  

The Narrow Neck CrossFit $\textcircled{1}$ (NNC) Implant is a $3.3{\mathsf{m m}}$ diameter implant with a narrow prosthetic platform. The NNC Implant is a Standard Plus (SP) Tissue Level Implant with a machined neck of $1.8\mathsf{m m}$ in height. The implant body and thread design is the same as the Straumann ${\textsuperscript{\textregistered}}3.3\mathsf{m m}$ Bone Level NC Implant.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/fc125f399849a3e355218cb960dc9b5251cb323030d5eb94d263c0163aadab63.jpg)  

#### 1.3.3	 Straumann® Bone Level CrossFit® connection  

The CrossFit® connection of Straumann® Bone Level Implants applies the know-how and benefits from the Straumann® synOcta® Morse taper connection to the connection requirements at bone level. Similar to the Straumann® synOcta® connection, the mechanically locking friction fit of the $15^{\circ}$ conical-cylindrical CrossFit® connection with four internal grooves has excellent long-term stability under all loading conditions and virtually eliminates screw loosening. The CrossFit® connection is available for Straumann® Bone Level Implants only.  

Straumann® Bone Level $\varnothing4.1\mathsf{m m}$ and $\varnothing4.8\mathsf{m m}$ Implants have the same connection, the Regular CrossFit® connection (RC), and share the same secondary components. Straumann® Bone Level $\mathcal{O}3.3\mathsf{m m}$ Implants feature the narrow CrossFit® connection (NC). The corresponding secondary components are color-coded:  

ѹ yellow $=N C$ connection ѹ magenta $={\mathsf{R C}}$ connection

### 1.4 MATERIAL  

Roxolid® is a groundbreaking material specifically designed for use in dental implantology. The titaniumzirconium alloy is stronger than pure titanium1,2 and has excellent osseointegration properties3-5. This combination of properties is unique in the market, since no other metallic alloy unifies high mechanical strength and osteoconductivity.  

Thanks to their outstanding biological and mechanical properties, Roxolid® Implants offer more treatment options than conventional titanium implants.  

### 1.5 SURFACE  

SLActive® significantly accelerates the osseointegration process and delivers everything you expect from a successful and patient-friendly implant treatment.  

ѹ High success and survival rates in compromised patients: diabetic, smokers, irradiated patients⁶-9   
ѹ SLActive® reduces initial healing time to 3 – 4 weeks\*10-14   
ѹ Increased treatment predictability in critical ­protocols6-17  

Most implant failures occur in the critical early period between weeks 2 and 4. Although similar healing patterns were observed for both $\mathsf{S L A}^{\otimes}$ and SLActive® Implants, bone-to-implant contact (BIC) was greater after 2 weeks and significantly greater after 4 weeks for SLActive® $\mathsf{\Pi}_{\mathsf{\Pi}}^{\mathsf{^{\prime}p}}$ -value $<0.05$ ).10  

### 1.6 TRANSFER PIECE  

The Bone Level Tapered Implants are delivered with the Loxim® Transfer Piece, which is connected to the implant with a snap-in mounting.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/d853aa10194d119f1b57c24c20606ed10cb63f2cad2196ff473e27a75bc0cc9f.jpg)  
Roxolid® shows a $20\%$ higher tensile strength than Straumann cold-worked ­titanium and a $80\%$ higher strength than standard titanium Grade 4.

## 3.	 PREOPERATIVE PLANNING  

### 3.1 IMPLANT POSITION  

The implant is the focal point of the dental restoration. It provides the basis for planning the surgical procedure. Close communication between the patient, dentist, surgeon and dental technician is imperative for achieving the desired prosthetic result.  

To establish the topographical situation, the axial orientation, and the choice of implants, we recommend the following:   
ѹ Make a wax-up/set-up on the previously prepared study cast.   
ѹ Define the type of superstructure.  

The wax-up/set-up can later be used as the basis for a custom-made X-ray or drill template and for a temporary restoration.  

Note: The implant abutments should always be loaded axially. Ideally, the long axis of the implant is aligned with the cusps of the opposing tooth. Extreme cusp formation should be avoided. It can lead to unphysiological loading.  

The implant diameter, implant type, position and number of implants should be selected individually, taking the anatomy and spatial circumstances (e.g. malpositioned or inclined teeth) into account. The measurements given here should be regarded as minimum guidelines. Only when the minimum distances are observed is it possible to design the restoration so that the necessary oral hygiene measures can be carried out.  

The final hard and soft tissue response is influenced by the position between the implant and the proposed restoration. Therefore, it should be based on the position of the implant-abutment connection. The implant position can be viewed in three dimensions:  

ѹ Mesiodistal ѹ Orofacial ѹ Coronoapical  

#### 3.1.1	 Mesiodistal implant position  

The mesiodistal bone availability is an important factor for choosing the implant type and diameter as well as the inter­ implant distances in the case of multiple implants. The point of reference on the implant for measuring mesiodistal distances is always the shoulder, being the most voluminous part of the implant. Note that all distances given in this chapter are rounded to $0.5\mathsf{m m}$ . The following basic rules are recommended:  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/18176c489b2aaaa1fac4bc2d3afeb9b8b7d9d28db14d74a3b232984ca198413d.jpg)  
Distance to adjacent tooth at bone level: A minimal distance of $1.5\mathsf{m m}$ from the implant shoulder to the adjacent tooth at bone level (mesial and distal) is recommended.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/4a2df97e361a20da50e04fe08d8aa4dd987443005304b58ec5b5c46c530c041d.jpg)  
Rule 2 Distance to adjacent implants at bone level: A minimal distance of $3\mathsf{m m}$ between two adjacent implant shoulders (mesiodistal) is recommended.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/ca4d2e5bbe12563bfa2470aacfc82af3234f9b3274a826afd092e57c0b1c9bef.jpg)  

#### 3.1.1.1	 Examples for single-tooth gaps  

For single-tooth restoration, the implant is placed centered within the single-tooth gap. The following examples show how Rule 1 is implemented.  

#### Straumann® Standard and Standard Plus Implants  

For Straumann® Tissue Level Implants, the gap size has to be considered for the selection of the shoulder diameter (NNC, RN, WN). In order to make use of the gap width in conjunction with Rule 1, the following approximation can be used.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/d2754f52d79c3190ba73479bd7655ec2a755c2e345bed4b32280c4fb4b19c400.jpg)  

The distance between adjacent teeth at bone level is approximately 1 mm $(2\times0.5\mathsf{m m})$ more than the gap width. Hence, applying Rule 1, the gap width must be $2{\mathsf{m m}}$ wider than the implant shoulder.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/f45766fe900639ab7b82b78ed6479fc65b896204c3b9b6f1722b9b19388d1e58.jpg)

\* Rule 1 applied on both implant sides The Diagnostic T, applied in the patient’s mouth or on the cast, can be used to obtain an initial measurement of the gap width for the choice of the implant shoulder diameter and prosthetic reconstruction.  

#### Straumann® Bone Level Implants  

For Straumann® Bone Level Implants, the distance between adjacent teeth at bone level determines the implant diameter.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/5afa3ab4d8f418ce97c58b6ea6da8ce548084518b5a573663e711af793980b98.jpg)

#### 3.1.1.2	 Examples of multiple-tooth gaps  

The following examples show how Rules 1 and 2 are implemented in multiple-tooth gaps. The measurement is made at bone level from the adjacent tooth to the center of the implant and between implant centers. The minimal ­distance of 3 mm between two adjacent implant shoulders (Rules 2) is important to facilitate flap adaptation, avoid proximity of secondary components and provide adequate space for maintenance and home-care.

#### 3.1.2	 Orofacial implant position  

The facial and palatal bone must be at least 1 mm thick in order to ensure stable hard and soft tissue conditions. The minimal orofacial ridge widths for individual implant types are given in the indication tables in chapter 2.2. Within this limitation, a restoration-driven orofacial implant position and axis should be chosen such that screw-retained restorations are possible.  

Caution: An augmentation procedure is indicated where the orofacial bone wall is less than 1 mm or a layer of bone is missing on one or more sides. This technique should be employed only by dentists who have adequate experience in the use of augmentation procedures.

Choose the orofacial implant position and axis so that the screw channel of the screw-retained restoration is located behind the incisal edge.  

#### 3.1.3	 Coronoapical implant position  

Straumann® dental implants allow for flexible coronoapical implant positioning, depending on individual anatomy, implant site, the type of restoration planned, and preference. In the anterior area, a deeper coronoapical implant position is better for esthetic reasons. In this situation, the use of Straumann® Standard Plus or Bone Level Implants is recommended. The following illustration shows the coronoapical implant position for these implants.  

#### Straumann® Standard Implants  

Straumann® Standard Implants with a smooth neck section of $2.8\mathsf{m m}$ are submerged in the bone as far as the margin of the SLA®/SLActive® surface.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/5af4205f7edb100f37a61eac5d5bd26bacad6accff0b2a7e649e6d79a0d317b4.jpg)  

#### Straumann® Standard Plus Implants  

Straumann® Standard Plus Implants with a smooth neck section of $1.8\mathsf{m m}$ are submerged in the bone as far as the margin of the Straumann® SLA®/­SLActive® surface. Optionally they can be placed slightly deeper if necessary.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/e83caf2c88b2a3ea61f65ad11fff8b6dab6a8f6f31a260aef6a6e65de6052f1f.jpg)  

Ideally, in the esthetic region, the implant shoulder should be positioned about 1 mm apical to the cemento-enamel junction (CEJ) of the contralateral tooth or $2\mathsf{m m}$ subgingival of the prospective gingival margin.  

Caution: If a Straumann® Tissue Level Implant is inserted deeper than the margin of the Straumann® SLA®/ SLActive® surface, the preparation depth must be increased accordingly (see Chapter 4.1.2).  

#### Straumann® Bone Level Implants  

Straumann® Bone Level Implants are best set with the outer rim of the narrow $45^{\circ}$ sloping edge (chamfer) at bone level.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/045cc254422a28a55df96a14a4cc11f383fc2e9fa12266f5c2bdd8ea2484be3c.jpg)  

Ideally, in the esthetic region, the implant shoulder should be positioned about $3-4{\mathsf{m m}}$ subgingival of the prospective gingival margin and with the correct implant orientation (See Chapter 4.3).  

In a scalloped situation, place the mesial/distal point of the outer rim of the implant to bone level. The lingual/palatal wall will then extend slightly over the top line of the implant. The buccal wall is located somewhat below the implant edge.

Two types of Implant Distance Indicators are available: ѹ For Straumann® Standard and Standard Plus Implants (art. no. 046.148) ѹ For Straumann® Bone Level Implants (art. no. 026.0901)  

The disks of the Implant Distance Indicators display the shoulder diameters of Straumann® implants. The Implant Distance Indicators can be used to check the available space before the start of treatment or intraoperatively to mark the desired implant site.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/5abfcef4afa4d1172fb29c784a94b38574e212b797bba48e7d97c4c7ebfa4258.jpg)

#### 3.2.2	 Determining the vertical bone availability  

The vertical bone availability determines the maximal allowable length of the implant that can be placed. To make it easier in determining the vertical bone availability, the use of an X-ray Template with X-ray Reference Spheres is recommended.  

#### 3.2.2.1	 X-ray Reference Sphere  

The X-ray Reference Sphere (art. no. 049.076V4) has a diameter of 5 mm. The image of the sphere on the X-ray provides the reference value for the magnification scale. To prepare a reference spherecarrying template, the selected implant positions are marked on the study cast. The X-ray Reference Spheres are fixed at the marked points. The vacuum-formed template is then made with the spheres. The subsequent X-ray shows the vertical bone availability and mucosal thickness, from which the corresponding implant length and type can be derived, in consideration of the enlargement factor.  

Warning: Adhere to production requirements of the holding template and ensure that the X-ray Reference Sphere is securely fixed within the holding template.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/ce92ecc613bad2f92889f612eb34a0152d24d999e2da2674c55cd833846113a8.jpg)  

#### 3.2.2.2	 X-ray Templates  

The $\mathsf{X}$ -ray Templates are used for measurement and comparison. They also assist the user in selecting the suitable implant type, diameter and length. The following X-ray Templates are available:  

ѹ For Straumann® Standard and Standard Plus Implants (art. no. 150.215) ѹ For Straumann® Bone Level Implants (art. no. 150.216)  

Similar to the distortions that occur in X-rays, the implant dimensions are shown on the individual templates with the corresponding distortion factors (1:1 to 1.7:1).  

Determining each magnification factor or scale is facilitated by showing the X-ray Reference Sphere on the template (next to the scale reference).  

The first stage consists of comparing the size of the X-ray Reference Sphere on the patient’s X-ray with the size of the reference sphere on the template. By superimposing the two pictures, the correct scale can be found. Next, the spatial relations around the implant position are determined and the implant length and insertion depth are established.  

Warning: Use only the X-ray Template specific to the implant type.

Please note: Narrow Neck CrossFit® and Standard plus 4 mm Implants have a Standard Plus neck design, but both implant types require Bone Level tapping.  

Basic implant bed preparation involves ridge preparation and twist drilling. For Twist Drilling, the endosteal diameter of the implant $(3.3/4.1/4.8\mathsf{m m})$ – not the implant type or the bone class – determines which instruments have to be used.  

Fine implant bed preparation involves profile drilling and tapping, if required. For tapping, the implant type (S/SP/BL) and the bone class determine which instruments have to be used.  

#### 4.1.1	 Basic implant bed preparation  

After the gingiva is opened, the basic implant bed preparation begins with preparation of the alveolar ridge (Step 1) and marking of the implantation site with a Round Bur or a Needle Drill (Step 2). The implant bed is then prepared with Pilot Drills and Twist Drills (Steps 3 – 7), according to the endosteal implant diameter chosen in the preoperative planning (see Chapter 3).  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/cef574d3976b903961bc264869af97add610c7fb41a1f7f2b2921f236fa62603.jpg)  

#### Step 1 – Prepare the alveolar ridge  

Carefully reduce and smooth a narrow tapering ridge with a large Round Bur. This will provide a flat bone surface and a sufficiently wide area of bone.  

Note: When choosing the implant length, the vertical reduction of the bone has to be considered.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/2066295f9ea425ab339b5fa8522162ff532b8821fa79efd40419198582ebfbd3.jpg)  

#### Step 2 – Mark the implantation site  

Mark the implantation site determined during the implant position planning with the $\varnothing1.4\mathsf{m m}$ Round Bur or the $\mathcal{O}1.6$ Needle Drill. The Implant Distance Indicator can be used for this purpose. If the Distance Indicator is used together with the Needle Drill to mark the implant position, make sure not to drill more than $3\mathsf{m m}$ in order to avoid any collision between the Needle Drill and the Distance Indicator.  

Widen and correct the position of the mark with the $\varnothing2.3\mathsf{m m}$ or the $\mathcal{O}3.1\mathsf{m m}$ Round Bur, if necessary.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/511fc5f8852dede092ce8c2cfbb951285c0f2117c92a8ffde653d5d70f4a3736.jpg)  

#### Step 3 – Mark the implant axis  

With the $\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}2.2\mathsf{m m}$ Pilot Twist Drill PRO, mark the implant axis by drilling to a depth of about 6 mm – except for $4\mathsf{m m}\mathsf{S P S}$ Implants, where the drilling depth must not exceed $4\mathsf{m m}$ .  

Insert the short side of the Depth Gauge with the Implant Distance Indicator to check for correct implant axis orientation.  

If necessary, correct unsatisfactory implant axis orientation in the following step.  

Note: The Implant Distance Indicator visualizes the shoulder diameter of $4.8\mathsf{m m}$ (RN) and enables checking of the probable position of the implant shoulder.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/31007f8cf5fc4682832cb8601001fc6e2779af2740388c8516ed99be03c6fed5.jpg)  

#### Step 4 – Prepare the implant bed to $\theta2.2\mathsf{m m}$  

Pre-drill the implant bed to the final preparation depth with the $\varnothing2.2{\mathsf{m m}}$ Pilot Twist Drill PRO.  

Use the $\ensuremath{\mathcal{O}}2.2\mathsf{m m}$ Alignment Pin to check the implant axis and preparation depth.  

Caution: At this point take an X-ray, particularly with vertically reduced bone availability. The Alignment Pin is inserted into the drilled area, which allows a comparative visualization of the drill hole in relation to the anatomical structures.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/c2e3736e6291d6ecb583a6d9c55d0d15a3d988235a4c9783532c9e9f925ca03e.jpg)  

Step 5 – Widen the implant bed to $\varnothing2.8\mathsf{m m}$ Continue with the implant bed preparation.  

If necessary, correct the implant position with the $\delta2.8\mathsf{m m}$ Twist Drill PRO. Use the $\varnothing2.8\mathsf{m m}$ Depth Gauge to check the preparation depth.  

For an implant with an endosteal diameter of $3.3\mathsf{m m}$ , basic preparation ends here. Continue with the fine implant bed preparation.

For $\varnothing4.1\mathsf{m m}$ and $\varnothing4.8\mathsf{m m}$ implants  

#### Step 6 – Widen the implant bed to $\theta3.5\mathsf{m m}$  

Continue with the $\varnothing3.5\mathsf{m m}$ Straumann® Twist Drill PRO and check the final preparation depth with the $\varnothing3.5\mathsf{m m}$ Depth Gauge.  

For an implant with an endosteal diameter of $4.1\mathsf{m m}$ , basic preparation ends here. Continue with the fine implant bed preparation.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/7cb8ea8bcfa29b9f429ca116c7cd28bde6e41530d76b0dc80a8fe37db9fadc5e.jpg)  

For $\alpha4.8\mathsf{m m}$ implants  

Step 7 – Widen the implant bed to $\theta4.2\mathsf{m m}$ Continue with the $\varnothing4.2{\mathrm{mm}}$ Straumann® Twist Drill PRO and check the final preparation depth with the $\varnothing4.2{\mathrm{mm}}$ Depth Gauge.

#### 4.1.2	 Fine implant bed preparation  

The fine implant bed preparation encompasses profile drilling and subsequent tapping. Instrumentation depends on the implant type, the endosteal implant diameter, and the bone class.  

#### Profile drilling  

The Profile Drill prepares the implant bed for a specific Straumann® implant.  

ѹ Straumann® Standard Plus and Bone Level Implants require profile drilling with specific instruments. This is independent of the bone class. Due to the unflared neck portion, Standard Plus $\varnothing4.8\mathsf{m m}$ RN Implants are inserted without profile drilling.   
ѹ Straumann® Standard Implants are inserted without profile drilling.  

When inserting a Straumann® Standard Plus Im­plant up to the implant shoulder level (see Chapter 3), the preparation depth must be $2\mathsf{m m}$ deeper than the indicated implant length. (Example: The preparation depth for a $\boldsymbol{10}\boldsymbol{\mathrm{mm}}\mathsf{S P}$ Implant inserted up to shoulder level must be $12\mathsf{m m}$ .) The Profile Drill should also be used deeper for fine implant bed preparation. Examples are illustrated below

The Drill Extender (art. no. 040.563) can be used with Profile Drills to increase the overall instrument length by $15\mathsf{m m}$ . This helps to gain access between long crowns of adjacent teeth.

#### Tapping  

Tapping prepares the implant bed for a specific thread type. It is an optional step that gives the surgeon the flexibility to adjust the surgical protocol to the bone class to help achieve optimal primary stability. It is recommended in hard bone in order to keep the insertion torque in a desirable range.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/1d582d7e37c296ef3bf8255a7446b0ae111c0329e5f81e67ca059508c7f2f7ce.jpg)  

Caution: Straumann® Taps are to be used only for the corresponding implant type!  

Please note: For NNC and SP 4 mm Implants, the corresponding diameter BL Taps must be used.

#### Step 3 – Place the implant  

Place the implant with the Handpiece into the implant bed. Move the implant into its final position with a maximum of 15 rpm turning it clockwise.  

#### Step 3 – Place the implant  

Place the implant with the Ratchet into the implant bed. Move the implant into its final position with a maximum of 15 rpm turning it clockwise.  

Caution: Vertical position corrections using reverse rotations (counterclockwise) may lead to a decrease in primary stability.  

Caution: Vertical position corrections using reverse rotations (counterclockwise) may lead to a decrease in primary stability.  

Caution: An insertion torque of 35 Ncm is recommended. If 35 Ncm is achieved before the implant has assumed its final ­position, check that the implant bed preparation is correct to avoid bone overcompression.  

The Loxim® is provided with a pre-determined breaking point to prevent damage to the inner configuration of the implant, thus ensuring the integrity of the interface for mounting the prosthesis.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/438878b74cfc5050e08a859c9bd283bc92df104d7c1f4821871ff04f3830c238.jpg)  

#### Step 4 – Correct implant orientation for Straumann® implants with CrossFit® connection  

While approaching the final implant position, make sure that the drilled holes on the blue transfer part are oriented exactly orofacially. This positions the four protrusions of the internal connection for ideal prosthetic abutment orientation. A quarter turn to the next drilled hole corresponds to a ­vertical displacement of $0.2{\mathsf{m m}}$ . The drilled holes also show the depth of the implant shoulder in the bone.  

Caution: Avoid vertical position corrections using reverse rotations (counterclockwise). This can cause loosening of the transfer part and may lead to a decrease in primary stability.  

#### Additional information for implants with the Loxim® Transfer Piece  

For situations in which any removal force is to be avoided, a release aid for the Loxim® can be used. Place the release aid onto the implant shoulder and hold it in place while detaching the Adapter with the Loxim®.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/e744acf8b54eade50c8662af254eddcd24064a181dd10f6e3ce2d8840cd9ce2d.jpg)

#### Step 5 – Remove the instruments with ­Loxim®  

Loxim® can easily be re-inserted to finish an uncompleted implant placement until the implant is fully inserted. If the implant needs to be removed during implantation surgery, Loxim® allows for counterclock­wise turns.  

After insertion, the Loxim® is detached with the Adapter.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/cb827d324c8098a164150da7f339f16884dcd822432dc0f2cc615cbd79b4055b.jpg)  

#### Step 5 – Remove the instruments with ­Loxim®  

Loxim® can easily be re-inserted to finish an uncompleted implant placement until the implant is fully inserted. If the implant needs to be removed during implantation surgery, Loxim® allows for counterclock­wise turns.  

Remove the Ratchet while holding the Adapter at the bottom, and then detach the Adapter-Loxim® assembly.  

#### Important additional information  

An insertion torque of $35N c m$ is recommended. If 35 Ncm is achieved before the implant has reached its final position, make sure the implant bed preparation is correct to avoid bone overcompression.  

Warning: If the implant has to be removed after implant placement, the retention of the Loxim® in the implant may be reduced. Always secure the implant against aspiration when removing the implant.  

The Loxim® is provided with a pre-determined breaking point to prevent damage to the implant’s inner configuration, thus ensuring the integrity of the interface to mount the prosthesis. If the Loxim® breaks during implant insertion, one part remains in the Adapter and the other part in the implant. Both parts can be removed with tweezers.  

To extract the implant after breakage at the pre-determined breaking point, simply take out the broken part of the Loxim® from the Adapter and re-insert the Adapter on the Loxim® part remaining in the implant. Counterclockwise turns will remove the implant.  

The part of the Loxim® below the pre-determined breaking point is not secured in the Adapter and, additionally, needs to be secured against aspiration when taking out the implant.  

Caution: The broken part of the Loxim® no longer protects against high torque.   
Therefore, it is not to be used to advance the placement of the implant.

### 4.4 SOFT TISSUE MANAGEMENT  

After implantation, the implant is closed – hand-tightened – with an SCS Closure Screw, Healing Cap or Healing Abutment to protect the implant (for SCS Screwdrivers see Chapter 6.1.8). The surgeon can choose between submucosal and transmucosal healing and has many options available for soft tissue management through a set of secondary ­healing components.  

#### 4.4.1	 Submucosal healing  

For submucosal healing (healing under closed mucoperiosteal flap) the use of a Closure Screw, shorter Healing Cap or Healing Abutment is recommended. Submucosal healing is suggested in esthetic indications and for implantations with simultaneous guided bone restoration (GBR) or membrane technique. A second surgical procedure is required for uncovering the implant and inserting the desired secondary component.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/fee2f8930d3d263ca3423b9268fcf12d0f99f52138d7a57c6423837fac9a6f2a.jpg)  

#### Step 1 – Inserting the Closure Screw after first ­surgery  

Ensure that the internal configuration of the implant is clean and bloodless.  

Pick up the Closure Screw with the SCS Screwdriver. The friction fit will secure the Closure Screw to the instrument during insertion and will allow safe handling.  

Hand-tighten the Closure Screw. The design will provide a tight connection between the two components.  

Note: All Closure Screws are delivered sterile and ready to use.  

Subsequent loosening is made easier by applying chlor­hexidine gel or sterile Vaseline® to the Closure Screw before it is screwed into the implant.

Step 3 – Reopening and removal: second surgery Locate the implant.  

Make a small crestal incision down to the Closure Screw.  

Spread the flap slightly and remove the Closure Screw with the SCS Screwdriver.  

Step 4 – Insertion and wound closure Rinse the exposed internal connection of the implant ­thoroughly with sterile saline solution.  

Insert a suitable secondary component.  

Adapt the soft tissue and suture it back tightly without ­tension around the secondary component.  

#### 4.4.2	 Transmucosal healing  

A versatile portfolio of Healing Caps and Healing Abutments is available for all Straumann® implants, enabling soft-tissue sculpturing during transmucosal healing. They are recommended for intermediate use. After the soft-tissue healing phase they are replaced with the appropriate temporary or final restoration.  

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/f6d5e9173c548637bf21e9d6811d2441da9892cd122697f2a8a303ce9c795a21.jpg)  

#### Step 1 – Insertion  

Ensure that the internal configuration of the implant is clean and bloodless.  

Insert the Healing Cap or Healing Abutment with the SCS Screwdriver. The friction fit secures the components to the instrument during insertion and ensures safe handling.  

Hand-tighten the Healing Cap or Healing Abutment. The design will provide a tight connection between the two components.  

Subsequent loosening is made easier by applying chlorhexidine gel or sterile Vaseline® to the Healing Cap or Healing Abutment before they are screwed into the implant.

## 6. 	ADDITIONAL INFORMATIONON INSTRUMENTS  

### 6.1 SURGICAL INSTRUMENTS  

Instruments must be checked for completeness and function. An adequate stock of implants and spare sterile instruments should always be available. The instruments must be disassembled for sterilization. Well-maintained instruments prevent infections from developing that could endanger both the patients and the practice team.  

To avoid contamination of the operation field, all the instruments aundsm terials employed must be sterile. To prevent contamination of the sterile instruments, they should be removed from the Surgical Cassette with the sterile Instrument Tweezers and put into the handle or Ratchet. The Instrument Tweezers (art. no. 046.110) were developed and shaped specially to allow round instruments to be gripped securely.

![](https://cdn-mineru.openxlab.org.cn/extract/fe258691-9723-4cc4-8ff5-c16d3c183a6a/ddf916200476ec359bbd33ca3eab95012cf1435a85bfd7e491b62ee7bc9a67f7.jpg)  

#### 6.1.7	 Torque Control Device  

The Torque Control Device (art. no. 046.049) is an instrument for determining the torque applied to various screw connections. A specific force/torque (Ncm) is transferred to the screw connection by means of a torque bar mounted on the ratchet. A calibration mark shows the measured tightening torque.  

If the torque bar is aligned with the zero mark at rest, the precision of the displayed tightening torque is within $\pm2$ Ncm. The torque bar must not be bent beyond the calibration mark on the scale, otherwise the precision can no longer be guaranteed or the bar may break.  

Recommended torque values are defined by optimal conditions for the specific screw connections of the Straumann® System. The individual clinical situation (bone quality, implant length, implant type, implant sur­face, time of application of force, etc.) also has to be considered apart from the recommended torque values.

### 6.2	 OSTEOTOMES  

#### 6.2.1	 Instrument set for bone condensation  

ѹ Indicated in cases with cancellous bone (bone classes 3 and 4).   
ѹ Reinforces bone radially to give improved primary stability to the implant.   
ѹ Before the instruments are used, it is advisable to mount the depth stops in order not to exceed the predetermined working depth. These are mounted onto the instrument using an SCS screwdriver.   
ѹ Instruments of increasing diameter are introduced manually using gentle rotary movements or, if necessary, lightly tapping with a hammer in accordance with the desired implant length and implant diameter.   
ѹ Insert the implant carefully without applying extra force.  

Note: The instruments with diameters of $2.2{\mathsf{m m}}$ , $2.8\mathsf{m m}$ , $3.5{\mathsf{m m}}$ and $4.2\mathsf{m m}$ match the implant diameters of the Straumann® Dental Implant System. They are available as straight or angled models, which facilitates access in the posterior region.

Insert Osteomes to the desired implant length using gentle rotary movements.  

#### 6.2.2	 Instrument set for transalveolar sinus floor elevation  

Indicated in cases with inadequate vertical bone. By tapping on the osteotomes with a mallet, the sinus floor can be fractured and elevated.  

ѹ The bone is prepared using the twist drills $(\emptyset2.2{\bmod{2}}.8{\mathsf{m m}}/3.5{\mathsf{m m}}/4.2{\mathsf{m m}})$ in accordance with the desired implant diameter. The surgeon feels his or her way very carefully down to the cortical bone of the sinus floor (minimum distance $\mathsf{1m m},$ . This process requires precise radiological planning.   
ѹ Before the instruments are used, it is advisable to mount the depth stops in order not to exceed the pre-­determined working depth. These are mounted onto the instrument using an SCS screwdriver.   
ѹ First, the sinus floor is fractured, which requires precise radiological planning. The use of depth stops is also recommended in order not to exceed the pre-determined working depth. The instrument is introduced by lightly tapping with a hammer in accordance with the desired implant length.   
ѹ During elevation, autologous and/or alloplastic filling or bone material should also be applied to the implant bed. The material introduced acts like a cushion, lifting the mucous membrane in accordance with the principles of hydraulics.   
ѹ Insert the implant carefully without applying extra force.  

Note: The instruments with diameters of $2.2{\mathsf{m m}}$ , $2.8\mathsf{m m}$ , $3.5{\mathsf{m m}}$ and $4.2\mathsf{m m}$ match the implant diameters of the Straumann® Dental Implant System. They are available as straight or angled models, which facilitates access in the posterior region.

### 6.3 CLEANING AND CARE OF INSTRUMENTS  

Careful treatment of all instruments is of the utmost importance. Even slight damage, for instance to the drill tips (e.g., when the drills are “thrown” into a metal bowl) impairs cutting performance and thus the clinical result. With correct and careful care, the high quality of the material and excellent workmanship ensure that the cutting instruments (drills, taps etc.) can be used repeatedly (up to a maximum of ten times is recommended). The Surgery Tracking Sheet for Straumann Cutting Instruments (152.755/en). helps to give an overview of how often the individual instruments have already been used.  

Instruments with high cutting performance are a basic requirement for successful implantation. The following should therefore be remembered:  

ѹ Never allow instruments to land on their tips.   
ѹ Use each instrument only for its intended purpose.   
ѹ Never let surgical residues (blood, secretion, tissue residues) dry on an instrument; clean immediately after surgery.   
ѹ Thoroughly clean off incrustations with soft brushes only. Disassemble instruments, clean cavities especially well.   
ѹ Never disinfect, clean (also ultrasound) or sterilize ­instruments made of different materials together.   
ѹ Use only cleaning agents and disinfectants intended for the material and follow the instructions for use of the manufacturer.   
ѹ Rinse disinfectants and cleaning agents very thoroughly with water.   
ѹ Never leave or store instruments moist or wet.
